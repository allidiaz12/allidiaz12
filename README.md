# About me ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a website called Potato World.  This is a website that is dedicated not only to my love of potatoes ðŸ¥”, but demonstrating what I've learned about HTML.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS through codeacademy.com and an HTML book they've recommended.  As stated above, I'm putting what I've learned into practice through my Potato World website.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others in order to improve my Potato World website and make it as cool as I can.  I'm currently struggling with the CSS portion and making it look how I see it in my brain.  Sometimes I wish I could just crack open my brain and poor out my vision to make it happen.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a website for my tia's woodworking business she has with my tio.  I showed her a short video of what I had done up to that point with Potato World and she said she wanted me to create their website.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my dogs. They're pretty much my children and I can talk about them all day.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: amarieabrams@gmail.com (maybe I should create an email account that reflects my married name ðŸ¤”)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a teacher for 7 years before I woke up and realized that it was not the place for me.
